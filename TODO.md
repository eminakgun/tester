## Implementation Todo List

The following are planned enhancements for the project:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Improvements

1. **Implement Makefile-Based Build System**
   - Create standardized Makefile templates for different tool flows
   - Support conditional compilation and simulation commands
   - Implement clean build and incremental build capabilities
   - Add debug build configurations

2. **Integrate with Edalize for EDA Tool Interaction**
   - Set up edalize Python package integration
   - Create tool-specific configurations for popular EDA tools
   - Develop wrapper functions for common tool operations
   - Implement tool version detection and compatibility checking

3. **Design Configuration File Architecture**
   - Define core configuration file structure and format
   - Establish configuration parsing and validation framework
   - Create modular configuration components for different system aspects
   - Design override mechanisms and hierarchy
   - Develop configuration examples and templates

4. **Enhance Results Reporting**
   - Implement proper logging of test results
   - Create HTML/CSV report generators
   - Add failure analysis tools

5. **Add Coverage Collection**
   - Integrate with coverage tools
   - Aggregate and report coverage metrics
   - Support threshold-based pass/fail

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

6. **Implement Direct Build System**
   - Create a direct build system implementation that doesn't rely on Makefiles
   - Support direct compilation and simulation commands
   - Optimize for performance compared to Makefile-based approach

7. **Implement Resource Management**
   - Add memory/CPU monitoring
   - Smart scheduling based on resource availability
   - Timeouts and resource limits

8. **Add Test Dependency Handling**
   - Support test dependencies in regressions
   - Smart test ordering based on dependencies
   - Failure impact analysis

9. **Implement Configuration Schema Validation**
   - Add JSON schema for configuration validation
   - Provide helpful error messages for misconfiguration
   - Support configuration inheritance and overrides

10. **Implement Configuration Management**
    - Add version control for configurations
    - Support environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod)
    - Create user-specific configuration profiles
    - Implement import/export functionality for sharing configurations
    - Develop configuration presets for common test scenarios

### Phase 3: User Experience

11. **Create Web Interface**
    - Implement a simple web UI for viewing results
    - Real-time progress monitoring
    - Interactive test selection and launching

12. **Improve CLI Experience**
    - Add interactive mode
    - Support command completion
    - Colorized output and progress bars

13. **Expand Documentation**
    - Comprehensive user guide
    - Video tutorials
    - Integration examples with CI/CD systems

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration

14. **Add CI/CD Integration**
    - GitHub Actions integration
    - Jenkins plugin
    - GitLab CI integration

15. **Implement Plugin System**
    - Support custom plugins for extending functionality
    - Provide hooks for pre/post test actions
    - Allow custom results processing

16. **Add Distributed Execution**
    - Support for running tests across multiple machines
    - Load balancing and resource sharing
    - Centralized result collection
